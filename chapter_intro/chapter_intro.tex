The study is focused on computer modelling of complex chemical and biophysical systems, which are described by partial differential equations (PDEs) with nonlinear boundary conditions and PDEs in various complex (non-rectangular) domains. These differential problems are solved using numerical methods. 
%The study is focused on solving systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) with nonlinear boundary conditions and solving PDE in various complex (non-rectangular) domains using numerical methods. 

Problems of solving PDEs with nonlinear boundary conditions arise from mathematical modelling of complex chemical and biological processes in scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). The study of PDE in non-rectangular domains is motivated by the demand to estimate measurement errors due to deviations of SECM equipment geometry from the standard. Nonlinear systems of PDE are applied in the study of chemotherapeutic drugs uptake into tissues.
